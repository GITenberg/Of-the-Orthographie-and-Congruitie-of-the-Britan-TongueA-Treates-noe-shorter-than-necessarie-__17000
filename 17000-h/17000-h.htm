<h2><a name = "preface">PREFACE.</a></h2>
<hr class = "tiny">

<p>The following Tract is now printed for the first time from the original
Manuscript in the old Royal Collection in the Library of the British Museum
(Bibl. Reg. 17 A. xi). It is written on paper, and consists of forty-five
leaves, the size of the pages being 5¾ in. by 3¾ in. The dedication, the
titles, and the last two lines, are written with a different coloured ink
from that employed in the body of the MS., and appear to be in a different
handwriting. It is probable that the tract was copied for the author, but
that he himself wrote the dedication to the King.</p>

<p>The Manuscript is undated, and we have no means of ascertaining the
exact time when it was written; but from a passage in the dedication to
James I. of England, it is fair to infer that it was written shortly after
the visit of that monarch to Scotland, subsequent to his accession to the
throne of the southern kingdom, that is, in the year 1617. This would make
it contemporaneous with Ben Jonson’s researches on the English Grammar; for
we find, in 1629, James Howell (Letters, Sec. V. 27) writing to Jonson that
he had procured Davies’ Welch Grammar for him, “to add to those many you
have.” The grammar that Jonson had prepared for the press was destroyed in
the conflagration of his study; so that the posthumous
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
work we now possess consists merely of materials, which were printed for
the first time in 1640, three years after the author’s death.</p>

<p>The Dedication of this Tract is merely signed <i>Alexander Hume</i>, and
contains no other clue to the authorship. Curiously enough there were four
Alexander Humes living about the same time, and three of them were educated
at St. Mary’s College, St. Andrew’s; only two, however, became authors, the
first of whom was Minister of Logie, and wrote <i>Hymnes or Sacred
Songes</i>. There can be little doubt, however, that the present grammar
was written by the Alexander Hume who was at one time Head Master of the
High School, Edinburgh, and author of <i>Grammatica Nova</i>.</p>

<p>From Dr. Steven’s History of the High School, Edinburgh, and from
M’Crie’s Life of Melville, I have been enabled to extract and put together
the following scanty particulars of our author’s life:&mdash;The time and
place both of his birth and of his death are alike unknown; but he himself,
on the title of one of his works, tells us that he was distantly connected
with the ancient and noble family of Home, in the county of Berwick. He was
educated at the school of Dunbar, under the celebrated Andrew Simson, and
in due time was enrolled a student in St. Mary’s College, St. Andrew’s, and
then took the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1574. He came to England, and
was incorporated at Oxford January 26, 1580-81, as “M.&nbsp;of A. of St.
Andrew’s, in Scotland.”<a class = "tag" href = "#note1" name =
"tag1"><sup>1</sup></a> He spent sixteen years in England, partly engaged
in studying and partly in teaching. During the latter part of this term he
was a schoolmaster at Bath, as appears from Dr. Hill’s answer to him,
published in 1592; and
<span class = "pagenum">vii</span>
the fact of his residence in this city is corroborated at page <a href =
"#page18">18</a> of the present treatise. He then returned to Scotland,
having gained a reputation for the excellence of his learning and for the
power he possessed of communicating it to others. On the dismissal of
Hercules Rollock, Rector of the High School, Edinburgh, from his office,
Hume was unanimously chosen to succeed him, and his appointment was dated
23rd April, 1596. During his incumbency the High School underwent many
changes, and received the form which it retains to the present day. In
March, 1606, Hume resigned his office to become principal master in the
grammar school founded a short time previously, at Prestonpans, by the
munificent John Davidson, minister of the parish. The following document
gives an account of Hume’s admission to this school:&mdash;</p>

<p>The school rapidly rose to distinction under Hume, but in 1615 he
relinquished his position, and accepted the Mastership of the Grammar
School of Dunbar, then in high repute, and the very same school in which he
had commenced his own education. When occupied at Dunbar, Hume had the
honour of being the first who, in a set speech, welcomed James VI. back to
his Scottish dominions, after an absence of fourteen years. The King
stopped on his way northward from Berwick on the 13th of May, 1617, at
Dunglass Castle the residence of the Earl of Home, and Hume, as the orator
of the day, delivered a Latin address.</p>

<p>The date of Hume’s death is not known; but he was witness to a deed on
the 27th of November, 1627; and later still, in the records of the Privy
Council of Scotland, 8th and 16th July, 1630, Mr. D. Laing tells me that
there is a memorandum of the King’s letter anent the Grammar of Mr.
Alexander Hume, “schoolmaster at Dunbar.” With regard to his private life,
we know that he was married to Helen Rutherford, and had two sons and a
daughter born to him in Edinburgh between the years 1601 and 1606. He was
the father of three more children, also two sons and a daughter, between
1608 and 1610, in the county of East Lothian.</p>

<p>Hume was a master in controversy, and wrote on subjects of polemical
divinity; but his mind was principally drawn
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
towards language and the rules of its construction. He especially gave much
of his time to the study of Latin grammar, and feeling dissatisfied with
the elementary books which were then in use, he drew up one himself, which
he submitted to the correction of Andrew Melville and other learned
friends, and published in 1612 under the title of <i>Grammatica Nova</i>.
The object he proposed to himself was to exclude from the schools the
grammar of the Priscian of the Netherlands, the celebrated John Van
Pauteren, but his work did not give the satisfaction which he had expected.
He succeeded, however, in his wishes after many reverses, by the help of
Alexander Seton, Earl of Dunfermline, Chancellor of Scotland, and by
authority both of Parliament and of the Privy Council his grammar was
enjoined to be used in all the schools of the kingdom. But through the
interest of the bishops, and the steady opposition of Ray, his successor at
the High School, the injunction was rendered of no effect. He would not,
however, be beaten, and we find that in 1623 he was again actively engaged
in adopting measures to secure the introduction of his grammar into every
school in North Britain where the Latin language was taught.</p>

<p>The following is a list of our author’s works:&mdash;

No place of printing, printer’s name, or date, but apparently printed at
London in 1592 or 1593. Dedicated to Robert Earl of Essex. Although this is
the first work that I can find attributed to Alexander Hume, yet there is
no doubt that there must have been a former one of which we have no record,
and the title and contents of Dr. Hill’s book would lead us to this
conclusion&mdash;“The Defence of the Article. Christ descended into Hell.

the sermon, is

is therefore merely a transcript. It is an epitome of Buchanan’s History,

Buchananum, and Bishop Nicholson (Scottish Hist. Lib.) praises its Latin
style.</div>

<p>The following three works are inserted by Dr. Steven in his list of
Hume’s writings, and have been supposed to be his by M’Crie and others; but
Mr. D. Laing believes “there can be no doubt, from internal evidence, that
the true author was Alexander Hume, the poet, who became minister of Logie,
near Stirling, in 1597, and who died in December, 1609.” In Wood’s Athenæ
Oxonienses, by Bliss, i., 624, it is stated that all three of them “were
printed in London in 1594, in October,” but this must, I think, be a
mistake.</p>

OF THE GROUNDES OF ORTHOGRAPHIE.</a><br>
Cap. 1.</h4>

<p>1. To wryte orthographicallie ther are to be considered the symbol, the
thing symbolized, and their congruence. Geve me leave, gentle reader, in a
new art, to borrow termes incident to the purpose, quhilk, being defyned,
wil further understanding.</p>

<p>2. The symbol, then, I cal the written letter, quhilk representes to the
eie the sound that the mouth sould utter.</p>

<p>3. The thing symbolized I cal the sound quhilk the mouth utteres quhen
the eie sees the symbol.</p>

<p>4. The congruence between them I cal the instrument of the mouth,
quhilk, when the eie sees the symbol, utteres the sound.</p>

<p>5. This is the ground of al orthographie, leading the wryter from the
sound to the symbol, and the reader from the symbol to the sound. As, for
exemple, if I wer to wryte God, the tuich of the midle of the tongue on the
roofe of the mouth befoer the voual, and the top of the tongue on the teeth
behind the voual, myndes me to wryte it g&nbsp;o&nbsp;d. The voual is
judged be the sound, as shal be shaued hereafter. This is the hardest
lesson in this treates, and may be called the key of orthographie.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_2">
OF THE LATINE VOUALES.</a><br>
Cap. 2.</h4>

<p>1. We, as almaest al Europ, borrow our symboles from the Romanes.
Quherforr, to rectefie our aun, first it behoves us to knaw their’s. Thei
are in nu<i>m</i>ber 23: a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r,
s, t, u, x, y, and&nbsp;z.</p>

<p>2. To omit the needless questiones of their order and formes; of them,
five be vouales, ane a noat of aspiration, and all the rest
consonantes.</p>

<p>3. A voual is the symbol of a sound maed without the tuiches of the
mouth.</p>

<p>4. They are distinguished the ane from the other be delating and
contracting the mouth, and are a, e, i, o,&nbsp;u.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page8"> </a>
5. Quhat was the right roman sound of them is hard to judge, seeing now we
heer nae romanes; and other nationes sound them after their aun idiomes,
and the latine as they sound them.</p>

<p>6. But seeing our earand is with our aun britan, we purpose to omit
curiosities, <i>et</i> quæ nihil nostra intersunt. Our aun, hou-be it
dialectes of ane tong, differing in the sound of them, differ alsoe in
pronuncing the latine. Quherfoer, to make a conformitie baeth in latine and
English, we man begin with the latine.</p>

<p>7. A, the first of them, the south soundes as beath thei and we sound it
in bare, nudus; and we, as beath thei and we sound it in bar, obex.</p>

<p>8. But without partialitie (for in this earand I have set my compas to
the loadstar of reason), we pronunce it better. If I am heer deceaved,
reason sall deceave&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>9. For we geve it alwaies ane sound beath befoer and behind the
consonant: thei heer ane and ther an other. As in amabant, in the first
tuae syllabes they sound it as it soundes in bare, and in the last as it
sounds in bar. Quherupon I ground this argument. That is the better sound,
not onelie of this, but alsoe of al other letteres, q<i>uhi</i>lk is
alwayes ane. But we sound it alwayes ane, and therfoer better. Ad that
their sound of it is not far unlyke the sheepes bae, q<i>uhi</i>lk the
greek symbolizes be η not α, <span class = "translit"
title = "bê">βη</span> not <span class = "translit" title =
"ba">βα</span>. See Eustat. in Homer.</p>

<p>10. Of this letter the latines themselfes had tuae other sounds
differing the ane from the other, and beath from this, quhilk they
symbolized be adding an other voual, æ and au. And these they called
diphthonges.</p>

<p>11. The diphthong they defyne to be the sound of tuae vouales coalescing
into ane sound, quhilk definition in au is plaen, in æ obscurer as now we
pronunce it, for now we sound it generallie lyke the voual e, without sound
of the a, q<i>uhi</i>lk, notwithstanding is the principal voual in this
diphthong sound. Questionles at the first it semes to have had sum
differing sound from a, sik as we pronunce in stean, or the south in stain.
But this corruption is caryed with a stronger tyde then reason can resist,
and we wil not stryve with the stream.</p>

<p>14. E followes, q<i>uhi</i>lk in reason sould have but ane sound, for
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<a name = "page9"> </a>
without doubt the first intent was to geve everie sound the awn symbol, and
everie symbol the awn sound. But as now we sound it in quies and quiesco,
the judiciouse ear may discern tuae soundes. But because heer we differ
not, I wil acquiess. My purpose is not to deal with impossibilities, nor to
mend al crookes, but to conform (if reason wil conform us) the south and
north beath in latine and in English.</p>

<p>15. Af this voual ryseth tuae diphthonges, ei and eu, quhilk beath
standes wel with the definition, sect.&nbsp;11.</p>

<p>16. Of the next, i, we differ farder, and the knot harder to louse, for
nether syde wantes sum reason. Thei in mihi, tibi, and sik otheres,
pronunce it as it soundes in bide, manere; we as it soundes in bid,
jubere.</p>

<p>17. Among the ancientes I fynd sum groundes for their sound. Cic. epist.
fam. lib. 9, epis. 22, avoues that bini, in latin, and
<span class = "translit" title =
"binei">βίνει</span> in Greek, had ane sound. And Varro, with sundrie
ancientes, wrytes domineis and serveis, for dominis and servis, quhilk is
more lyke the sound of bide then bid. If this argument reached as wel to i
short as i lang, and if we wer sure how ει was pronunced in those dayes,
this auctoritie wald over-weegh our reason; but seing i, in mihi,
<i>et</i>c., in the first is short, and in the last co<i>m</i>mon, and the
sound of ei uncertan, I stand at my reason, sect. 9, q<i>uhi</i>lk is as
powerful heer for i as ther for a. They pronunce not i in is and quis, id
and quid, in and quin, as they pronunce it in mihi, tibi, sibi, ibi,
<i>et</i>c., and therfoer not right.</p>

<p>18. As for o, in latin, we differ not; u, the south pronu<i>n</i>ces
quhen the syllab beginnes or endes at it, as eu, teu for tu, and eunum
meunus for unum munus, q<i>uhi</i>lk, because it is a diphthong sound, and
because they them selfes, quhen a consonant followes it, pronunce it other
wayes, I hoep I sal not need argumentes to prove it wrang, and not be a
pure voual.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_3">
OF THE BRITAN VOUALES.</a><br>
Cap. 3.</h4>

<p>1. Of a, in our tongue we have four soundes, al so differing ane from an
other, that they distinguish the verie signification of wordes, as, a tal
man, a gud tal, a horse&nbsp;tal.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">10</span>
<a name = "page10"> </a>
2. Quherfoer in this case I wald co<i>m</i>mend to our men the imitation of
the greek and latin, quho, to mend this crook, devysed diphthongs. Let the
simplest of these four soundes, or that q<i>uhi</i>lk is now in use, stand
with the voual, and supplie the rest with diphthonges; as, for exemple, I
wald wryte the king’s hal with the voual a; a shour of hael, with ae; hail
marie, with ai; and a heal head, as we cal it, quhilk the English cales a
whole head, with ea. And so, besydes the voual, we have of this thre
diphthonges, tuae with a befoer, ae and ai, and ane w<i>i</i>th the e
befoer, ea. Ad to them au, howbeit of a distinct sound; as, knaulege with
us, in the south knowlege.</p>

<p>3. These and al other diphthonges I wald counsel the teacheres not to
name be the vouales quherof they are maed, but be the sound q<i>uhi</i>lk
they maek, for learneres wil far maer easelie take the sound from the mouth
of the teacher, then maek it them selves of the vouales ingredient.</p>

<p>4. Of e, we have tuae soundes, q<i>uhi</i>lk it is hard to judge
q<i>uhi</i>lk is simplest; as, an el, ulna; and an el, anguilla; hel,
infernus; and an hel, calx pedis. Heer I wald com<i>m</i>end to our men
quhae confoundes these the imitation of the south, q<i>uhi</i>lk doth wel
distinguish these soundes, wryting the el, ulna, with the voual e, and eel,
anguilla, with the diphthong ee. I am not ignorant that sum symbolizes this
sound w<i>i</i>th a diphthong made of ie; eie, oculus; hiel, fiel, miel,
<i>et</i>c. Here I am indifferent, and onelie wishes that the ane be used;
let the advysed judge make choise of q<i>uhi</i>lk, for my awne paert I
lyke the last best; 1. becaus eie, oculus, can not wel be symbolized ee; 2.
because the greekes expresse η be εε, q<i>uhi</i>lk, as appeares be the
Ioneanes and Doreanes, drawes neerar to α, than&nbsp;ε.</p>

<p>5. Of i, also, our idiom receaves tuae soundes, as in a man’s wil, and
the wil of a fox. Heer, also, I wald have our men learne of the south, for
these soundes they wel distinguish, wryting wil, fil, mil, stil, with i;
and wyl, fyl, myl, styl, with&nbsp;y.</p>

<p>6. Heer I see be Barrat, in his Alvearie, that sum wald be at
symbolizing these soundes, the ane with the greek diphthong ει, and the
other with<span class = "translit" title = "inverted i"> ᴉ
</span>inverted; as, rειd, equitare; bειd, manere; <span class =
"translit" title = "inverted i">rᴉd</span>, legere; <span class =
"translit" title = "inverted i">hᴉd</span>, cavere. In this opinion I se
an eye of judgement, and therfoer wil not censure it, except I saw the
auctour’s whole drift. Onelie for
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<a name = "page11"> </a>
my awn parte I will avoid al novelties, and content my self with the
letteres q<i>uhi</i>lk we have in use. And seeing we have no other use of
y distinguished from i, condiscend to the opinion of the south using i
for ane, and y for the other.</p>

<p>7. O, we sound al alyk. But of it we have sundrie diphthonges: oa, as to
roar, a boar, a boat, a coat; oi, as coin, join, foil, soil; oo, as food,
good, blood; ou, as house, mouse, &amp;c. Thus, we com<i>m</i>onlie wryt
mountan, fountan, q<i>uhi</i>lk it wer more etymological to wryt montan,
fontan, according to the original.</p>

<p>8. In this diphthong we co<i>m</i>mit a grosse errour, saving better
judgement, spelling how, now, and siklyk with w, for if w be (as it sal
appear, quhen we cum to the awn place of it) a consonant, it can noe wayes
coalesse into a diphthong sound, sik as this out of controversie&nbsp;is.</p>

<p>9. U, the last of this rank, the south, as I have said in the latin
sound of it, pronu<i>n</i>ces eu, we ou, both, in my simple judgement,
wrang, for these be diphthong soundes, and the sound of a voual sould be
simple. If I sould judge, the frensh sound is neerest the voual sound as we
pronu<i>n</i>ce it in mule and muse.</p>

<p>10. Of it we have a diphthong not yet, to my knawlege, observed of anie;
and, for my awn parte, I am not wel resolved neither how to spel it, nor
name it. Onelie I see it in this, to bou, a bow. I wait not quhither I
sould spel the first buu, or the last boau. As, for exemple, if Roben Hud
wer nou leving, he wer not able to buu his aun bou, or to bou his aun boau.
And therfoer this with al the rest, hou be it in other I have more for me,
I leave to the censure of better judgement.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_4">
OF CONSONANTES.</a><br>
Cap. 4.</h4>

<p>1. This for the vouales, and diphthonges made of them without the
tuiches of the mouth. Now followe the consonantes.</p>

<p>2. A consonant is a letter symbolizing a sound articulat that is broaken
with the tuiches of the mouth.</p>

<p>3. The instrumentes of the mouth, quherbe the vocal soundes be
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page12"> </a>
broaken, be in number seven. The nether lip, the upper lip, the outward
teeth, the inward teeth, the top of the tongue, the midle tong, and roof of
the mouth. Of these, thre be, as it were, ha<i>m</i>meres stryking, and the
rest stiddies, kepping the strakes of the ha<i>m</i>meres.</p>

<p>4. The ham<i>m</i>eres are the nether lip, the top of the tongue, and
the midle tongue. The stiddies the overlip, the outward teeth, the inward
teeth, and the roofe of the mouth.</p>

<p>5. The nether lip stryking on the overlip makes b, m, p, and on the
teeth it makes f and&nbsp;v.</p>

<p>6. The top of the tongue stryking on the inward teeth formes d, l, n, r,
s, t, and&nbsp;z.</p>

<p>7. The midle tongue stryking on the rouf of the mouth formes the rest,
c, g, k, j, q, and x, and so we have 18 consonantes borrowed of the
latines.</p>

<p>8. These they borrow al from the greekes, saving j and v, quhilk our age
soundes other wayes then it seemes the romanes did; for Plutarch, more then
100 yeeres after Christ, expressing the sound q<i>uhi</i>lk they had in his
tyme, symbolizes them neerar the sound of the vouales quherof they are maed
then now we sound them in latin, for in Galba he symbolizes junius vindex,
<span class = "translit" title = "iounios ouindex">ἰόυνιος ὀύινδεξ</span>,
q<i>uhi</i>lk, if then it had sounded as now we sound it, he sould rather
have written it with γ and β, <span class = "translit" title =
"gounios bindex">γόυνιος βίνδεξ</span>.</p>

<p>9. We have in our use the sam soundes q<i>uhi</i>lk it seemes these
consonantes had in Plutarch’s dayes, as in yallou, winter. Quhilk, seeing
now they are worn out of the latin use, my counsel is that we leave the
sound of them q<i>uhi</i>lk now is in the latin use to the latines, and
take as our’s the sound q<i>uhi</i>lk they have left, and geve to the
sound, q<i>uhi</i>lk now we use in latin, the latin symbol; as, jolie jhon;
vertue is not vain; and to the soundes quhilk they have left the symboles
q<i>uhi</i>lk we have usurped to that end; as, yallou, youk; water,
wyne.</p>

<p>10. And heer, to put our men af their errour quho had wont to symboliz
yallou with an <span class = "translit" title = "yogh">ȝ</span>,
and to put noe difference betueen v and w, <span class = "translit"
title = "yogh">ȝ</span> is a dental consonant, broaken betueen the top
of the tongue and root of the teeth; yal, a guttural sound, made be a
mynt of the tongue to the roofe of the mouth, and therfoer the organes
being so
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
<a name = "page13"> </a>
far distant, and the tuich so diverse, this symbol can be no reason serve
that sound, nor nane of that kynd.</p>

<p>11. As for v and w, seeing we have in our idiom, besyd the latin sound,
an other never hard in latin, as now it is pronu<i>n</i>ced, I can not but
com<i>m</i>end the wisdom of the south, q<i>uhi</i>lk gave the latin sound
their awn symbol, and took to our sound a symbol quhilk they use not. Lyke
was their wisdom in j and y; for as the latines usurped the voual i for a
consonant in their use, q<i>uhi</i>lk the greekes had not, so they usurped
y, a voual not mikle different from i, for the correspondent sound, not
used in the latin as now it is pronu<i>n</i>ced.</p>

<p>12. Heerfoer, for distinctiones of both sound and symbol, I wald commend
the symbol and name of i and u to the voual sound; as, indifferent,
unthankful; the symbols of j and v to the latin consonantes, and their
names to be jod and vau; as, vain jestes; and the symboles y and w to our
English soundes, and their names to be ye and we, or yod and wau; as,
yonder, wel, yallou, wool.</p>

<p>13. Now remaineth h, q<i>uhi</i>lk we have called a noat of aspiration,
<a href = "#chap1_2">cap. 2</a>, sect. 2, and is, in deed, noe voual, because with a consonant it
makes noe sound; as, ch; nor consonant, because it is pronu<i>n</i>ced
without the tuich of the mouth; as,&nbsp;ha.</p>

<p>14. It may affect al vouales <i>and</i> diphthonges; as, hand, hen,
hind, hose, hurt, hail, hautie, health, heel, heifer, <i>etc.</i> But
behind the voual in our tong (so far as yet I can fynd) it hath no use. Of
consonantes, it affecteth g beyond the voual; as, laugh; p befoer the
voual; as, phason; s and t also befoer the voual; as, think, shame. With c
we spil the aspiration, tur<i>n</i>ing it into an Italian chirt; as,
charitie, cherrie, of quhilk hereafter.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_5">
OF OUR ABUSING SUM CONSONANTES.</a><br>
Cap. 5.</h4>

<p>1. Now I am cum to a knot that I have noe wedg to cleave, and wald be
glaed if I cold hoep for help. Ther sould be for everie sound that can
occur one symbol, and of everie symbol but one onlie sound. This reason and
nature craveth; and I can not but trow but that the worthie inventoures of
this divyne facultie shot at this mark.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page14"> </a>
2. But, contrarie to this sure ground, I waet not be quhat corruption, we
see, not onelie in our idiom, but in the latin alsoe, one symbol to have
sundrie soundes, ye, and that in one word; as, lego, legis.</p>

<p>3. First, to begin with c, it appeeres be the greekes, quho ever had
occasion to use anie latin word, quharein now we sound c as s, in their
tymes it sounded k; for Cicero, thei wryt Kikero; for Cæsar, Kaisar; and
Plut., in Galba, symbolizes principia, <span class = "translit" title =
"prinkipia">πρινκιπια</span>.</p>

<p>4. This sound of it we, as the latines, also keepe befoer a, o, and u;
as, canker, conduit, cumber. But, befoer e and i, sum tymes we sound it,
with the latin, lyke an s; as, cellar, certan, cease, citie, circle,
<i>et</i>c.</p>

<p>5. Behind the voual, if a consonant kep it, we sound it alwayes as a k;
as, occur, accuse, succumb, acquyre. If it end the syllab, we ad e, and
sound it as an s; as, peace, vice, solace, temperance; but nether for the
idle e, nor the sound of the s, have we anie reason; nether daer I, with al
the oares of reason, row against so strang a tyde. I hald it better to erre
with al, then to stryve with al and mend none.</p>

<p>6. This consonant, evin quher in the original it hes the awne sound, we
turn into the chirt we spak of, <a href = "#chap1_4">cap. 4</a>, sect. 14, quhilk, indeed, can be
symbolized with none, neither greek nor latin letteres; as, from cano,
chant; from canon, chanon; from castus, chast; from <span class =
"translit" title = "kyriakê">κυριακὴ</span>, a church, of q<i>uhi</i>lk
I hard doctour Laurence, the greek professour in Oxfoord, a man bothe of
great learni<i>n</i>g and judgement, utter his opinion to this sense, and
(excep my memorie fael me) in these wordes: <span class = "translit"
title = "kyriakê">κυριακὴ</span> ut <span class = "translit" title =
"basilikê">βασιλικὴ</span> suppresso substantivo <span class = "translit"
title = "oikia">ὀικία</span> domus domini est. Unde nostrum derivatur,
quod Scoti et Angli boreales recte, pronu<i>n</i>ciant a kyrk,
nos corrupte a church.</p>

<p>7. Yet, notwithstanding that it is barbarouse, seing it is more usual in
our tongue then can be mended befoer the voual, as chance, and behind the
voual, as such, let it be symbolized, as it is symbolized with ch, hou beit
nether the c nor the h hath anie affinitie with that sound; 1, because it
hath bene lang soe used; and 2, because we have no other mean to symbolize
it, except it wer with a new symbol, q<i>uhi</i>lk it will be hard to bring
in&nbsp;use.</p>

<p>8. Now, quheras ch in nature is c asperat, as it soundes in charus and
chorus; and seing we have that sound also in use, as licht, micht; if I had
bene at the first counsel, my vote wald have bene to have geven
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page15"> </a>
ch the awn sound. But as now the case standes, ne quid novandum sit, quod
non sit necesse, I not onlie consent, but also com<i>m</i>end the wisdom of
the south, quho, for distinction, wrytes light, might, with gh and referres
ch to the other sound, how be it improperlie, and this distinction I
com<i>m</i>end to our men, quho yet hes not satis attente observed&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>9. Next cumes g, howbe it not so deformed as c; for, althogh we see it
evin in latin, and that, in one word (as is said <a href = "#chap1_5">cap. 5</a>, sect. 2),
distorted to tuo sonndes, yet both may stand with the nature of the symbol
and differ not in the instrumentes of the mouth, but in the form of the
tuich, as the judiciouse ear may mark in ago, agis; agam, ages.</p>

<p>10. This consonant, in latin, never followes the voual; befoer a, o, u,
it keepes alwayes the awn sound, and befoer e and i breakes&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>11. But with us it may both begin and end the syllab; as, gang; it may,
both behind and befoer, have either sound; as, get, gist, gin, giant.</p>

<p>12. These the south hath providentlie minted to distinguish tuo wayes,
but hes in deed distinguished noe way, for the first sum hath used tuo gg;
as, egg, legg, bigg, bagg; for the other dg; as, hedge, edge, bridge; but
these ar not <span class = "translit" title =
"kata pantos">κατὰ πάντος</span>. Gyles, nomen
viri, can not be written dgiles; nor giles doli, ggiles; nether behind the
voual ar they general; age, rage, suage, are never wrytten with dg.
Quherfoer I conclud that, seeing nether the sound nor the symbol hath anie
reason to be sundrie, without greater auctoritie, nor the reach of a privat
wit, this falt is incorrigible.</p>

<p>13. Here I am not ignorant quhat a doe the learned make about the
symboles of c, g, k and q, that they be al symboles, but of one sound; but
I wil not medle in that question, being besyde my purpose, q<i>uhi</i>lk is
not to correct the latin symboles, but to fynd the best use of them in our
idiom.</p>

<p>14. T, the last of these misused souldioures, keepes alwayes it’s aun
nature, excep it be befoer tio; as, oration, declamation, narration; for we
pronunce not tia and tiu as it is in latin. Onelie let it be heer observed
that if an s preceed tio, the t keepes the awn nature, as in question,
suggestion, <i>et</i>c.</p>

OF THE SYLLAB.</a><br>
Cap. 6.</h4>

<p>1. Now followes the syllab, quhilk is a ful sound symbolized with
convenient letteres, and consistes of ane or&nbsp;moe.</p>

<p>2. A syllab of ane letter is symbolized with a voual onelie; as, a in
able, e in ever, i in idle, o in over, u in unitie, for a consonant can
make no syllab alane.</p>

<p>3. A syllab of moe letteres is made of vouales onelie, or els of vouales
and consonantes. Of onlie vouales the syllab is called a diphthong, of
quhilk we have spoaken in the vouales quherof they ar composed.</p>

<p>4. A syllab of vouales and consonantes either begin<i>n</i>es at the
voual, as al, il, el; or at one consona<i>n</i>t, as tal man; or at tuo
consona<i>n</i>tes, as stand, sleep; or els at thre at the maest, as
strand, stryp. It endes either at a voual, as fa, fo; or at one consonant,
as ar, er; or at tuo, as best, dart; or at thre at the maest, as durst,
worst.</p>

<p>5. Heer is to be noated, that in divyding syllabes, the consonantes, one
or moe, that may begin a syllab anie way in the middes of a word belong to
the voual following, as in que-stion, qua-rel, fi-shar, sa-fron, ba-stard,
de-scrib, re-scue.</p>

<p>6. It is alsoe heer to be observed in printing and wryting, that quhen a
word fales to be divyded at the end of a lyne, that the partition must be
made at the end of a syllab, soe that the one lyne end at the end of the
whol syllab, and the other begin the next lyne. As,
<span class = "pagenum">17</span>
<a name = "page17"> </a>
for exemple, if this word magistrat fel to be divided at the first syllab,
it behoved to be ma-gistrat; if at the second, it behoved to be magi-strat;
but no wayes to parte the m from the a, nor the g from the i, nor the s
from t, nor the t from&nbsp;r.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_7a">
OF THE RULES TO SYMBOLIZE.</a><br>
Cap. 7.</h4>

<p>1. To symboliz right, the sound of the voual is first to be observed,
quhither it be a simple voual or a compound, and quhilk of them is to be
chosen, for quhilk no rule can be geven but the judgeme<i>n</i>t of the
ear.</p>

<p>2. Next the consonantes are to be marked; and first, quhither they break
the voual befoer or behind; then quhither they be one or moe; and lastlie,
w<i>i</i>th quhat organes of the mouth they be broaken.</p>

<p>3. For be the organes of the mouth, quherwith the syllab is broaken, the
consonantes are discerned be quhilk the syllab must be symbolized, quhilk
we have said, cap 1, sect.&nbsp;5.</p>

<p>4. The consonantes may differ in hammar (as we called it, <a href = "#chap1_4">cap. 4</a>, sect
3) and stiddie, as b and d. Or they may agre in ham<i>m</i>er and differ in
stiddie, as b and v. Or they may agre in both and differ in the tuich, as f
and v, m and p, t and&nbsp;g.</p>

<p>5. The tuich befoer the voual is be lifting the ham<i>m</i>er af the
stiddie; as da, la, pa; and behind, be stryking the hammer on the stiddie;
as ad, al, ap. And quhen the hammer and the stiddie are ane, the difference
is in the hardnes and softnes of the tuich; as may be seen in ca and ga, ta
and da. But w and y maekes sae soft a mynt that it is hard to perceave, and
therfoer did the latines symboliz them with the symbol of the vouales. They
are never used but befoer the voual; as we, ye, wil, you; behynd the voual
thei mak noe consonant sound, nor sould be written, and therfore now and
vow, with sik otheres, are not [to] be written w<i>i</i>th w, as is said
befoer.</p>

<p>6. Of this q<i>uhi</i>lk now is said may be gathered that general,
q<i>uhi</i>lk I called the keie of orthographie, <a href = "#chap1_1">cap. 1</a> sect. 5, that is
the congruence of the symbol and sound symbolized; that is, that bathe must
belang to the same organes and be tuiched after the same form.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">18</span>
<a name = "page18"> </a>
7. And, be the contrarie, here it is clere that soundes pronu<i>n</i>ced
with this organ can not be written with symboles of that; as, for exemple,
a labiel symbol can not serve a dental nor a guttural sound; nor a guttural
symbol a dental nor a labiel sound.</p>

<p>8. To clere this point, and alsoe to reform an errour bred in the south,
and now usurped be our ignorant printeres, I wil tel quhat befel my self
quhen I was in the south with a special gud frende of myne. Ther rease,
upon sum accident, quhither quho, quhen, quhat, <i>et</i>c., sould be
symbolized with q or w, a hoat disputation betuene him and me. After manie
conflictes (for we ofte encountered), we met be chance, in the citie of
Baeth, w<i>i</i>th a Doctour of divinitie of both our acquentance. He
invited us to denner. At table my antagonist, to bring the question on foot
ama<i>n</i>gs his awn condisciples, began that I was becum an heretik, and
the doctour spering how, ansuered that I denyed quho to be spelled with a
w, but with qu. Be quhat reason? quod the D<i>octour</i>. Here, I
beginni<i>n</i>g to lay my gru<i>n</i>des of labial, dental, and guttural
soundes and symboles, he snapped me on this hand and he on that, that the
d<i>octour</i> had mikle a doe to win me room for a syllogisme. Then (said
I) a labial letter can not symboliz a guttural syllab. But w is a labial
letter, quho a guttural sound. And therfoer w can not symboliz quho, nor
noe syllab of that nature. Here the d<i>octour</i> staying them again (for
al barked at ones), the proposition, said he, I understand; the assumption
is Scottish, and the conclusion false. Quherat al laughed, as if I had bene
dryven from al replye, and I fretted to see a frivolouse jest goe for a
solid ansuer. My proposition is grounded on the 7 sectio of this same cap.,
q<i>uhi</i>lk noe man, I trow, can denye that ever suked the paepes of
reason. And soe the question must rest on the assumption quhither w be a
labial letter and quho a guttural syllab. As for w, let the exemples of
wil, wel, wyne, juge quhilk are sounded befoer the voual with a mint of the
lippes, as is said the same cap., sect. 5. As for quho, besydes that it
differres from quo onelie be aspiration, and that w, being noe perfect
consonant, can not be aspirated, I appele to al judiciouse eares, to
q<i>uhi</i>lk Cicero attributed mikle, quhither the aspiration in quho be
not ex imo gutture, and therfoer not labial.</p>

<h4><a name = "chap1_7b">
OF RULES FROM THE LATIN.</a><br>
Cap. 7. (<span class = "plainital">sic.</span>)</h4>


<p>1. Heer, seeing we borrow mikle from the latin, it is reason that we
either follow them in symbolizing their’s, or deduce from them the
groundes of our orthographie.</p>

<p>2. Imprimis, then, quhatever we derive from them written with c we sould
alsoe wryte with c, howbeit it sound as an s to the ignorant; as conceave,
receave, perceave, from concipio, recipio, percipio; concern, discern, from
concerno, discerno; accesse, successe, recesse, from accedo, succedo,
recedo, w<i>i</i>th manie moe, q<i>uhi</i>lk I com<i>m</i>end to the
attention of the wryter.</p>

<p>3. Also quhat they wryte w<i>i</i>th s we sould alsoe wryte with s; as
servant, from servus; sense, from sensus; session from sessio; passion,
from passio.</p>

<p>4. Neither is the c joined w<i>i</i>th s here to be omitted; as science
and conscience, from scientia, conscientia; ascend and descend, from
ascendo, descendo; rescind and abscind, from rescindo and abscindo.</p>

<p>4 (<i>sic</i>). This difference of c and s is the more attentivelie to
be marked for that wordes of one sound and diverse signification are many
tymes distinguished be these symboles; as, the kinges secrete council, and
the faithful counsil of a frende; concent in musik, and consent of myndes;
to duel in a cel, and to sel a horse; a decent weed, and descent of a noble
house. These tuo last differres alsoe in accent.</p>

<p>5. Lykwayes, that we derive from latin verbales in tio, sould also be
wrytten with t; as oration, visitation, education, vocation, proclamation,
admonition, <i>et</i>c.</p>

<p>6. Wordes deryved from the latin in tia and tium we wryte with ce; as
justice, from justitia; intelligence, from intelligentia; vice, from
vitium; service, from servitium. In al q<i>uhi</i>lk, houbeit the e behind
the c be idle, yet use hes made it tollerable to noat the breaking of the
c, for al tongues bear with sum slippes that can not abyde the tuich stone
of true orthographie.</p>

<p>7. C is alsoe written in our wordes deryved from x in latin; as peace,
from pax; fornace, from fornax; matrice, from matrix; nurice, from
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20"> </a>
nutrix, q<i>uhi</i>lk the south calles nurse, not without a falt both in
sound and symbol; be this we wryte felicitie, audacitie, tenacitie,
<i>et</i>c.</p>

<p>8. Lykwayes we sould keep the vouales of the original, quherin the north
warres the south; from retineo, the north retine, the south retain; from
foras, the north foran, the south forain; from regnu<i>m</i>, the north
regne, the south raigne; from cor, the north corage, the south courage;
from devoro, the north devore, the south devour; from vox, the north voce,
the south voice; from devoveo, the north devote, the south devoute; from
guerrum, the north were, the south war; from gigas, gigantis, the north
gyant, the south giaunt; from mons, montis, the north mont, the south
mount. Of this I cold reckon armies, but wil not presume to judge farther
then the compasse of my awn cap, for howbeit we keep nearar the original,
yet al tongues have their idiom in borrowing from the latin, or other
foran tongues.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_8">
OF SUM IDIOMES IN OUR ORTHOGRAPHIE.</a><br>
Cap. 8.</h4>

<p>1. In our tongue we have some particles q<i>uhi</i>lk can not be
symbolized with roman symboles, nor rightlie pronunced but be our awn, for
we in manye places soe absorb l and n behynd a consonant, quher they can
not move without a voual intervening, that the ear can hardlie judge
quhither their intervenes a voual or&nbsp;noe.</p>

<p>2. In this case sum, to avoid the pronu<i>n</i>ciation of the voual
befoer the l and n, wrytes it behind; as litle, mikle, muttne, eatne.
Quhilk houbeit it incurres in an other inconvenience of pronu<i>n</i>cing
the voual behind the l or n, yet I dar not presume to reprove, because it
passeth my wit how to avoid both inconveniences, and therfoer this I leave
to the wil of the wryter.</p>

<p>3. Sum of our men hes taken up sum unusual formes of symbolizing,
q<i>uhi</i>lk I wald wish to be reformed, yet if I bring not reason, let no
man change for my phantasie.</p>

<p>4. First, for peple they wryte people, I trow because it cumes from
populus; but if that be a reason, I wald understand a reason quhy
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
<a name = "page21"> </a>
they speak not soe alsoe. Or gif they speak not soe, I wald understand quhy
they wryte not as they speak. I knawe they have the exemple of France to
speak ane way and wryte an other; but that exemple is as gud to absorb the
s in the end of everie word. Al exemples are not imitable.</p>

<p>5. They use alsoe to wryte logicque, musicque, rhetoricque, and other of
that sorte, with cque. If this be doon to make the c in logica,
<i>et</i>c., subsist, quhy wer it not better to supply a k in the place of
it, then to hedge it in with a whol idle syllab; it wer both more
orthographical and easier for the learner, for c and k are sa sib,
<i>tha</i>t the ane is a greek and the other a latin symbol of one sound.
In this art it is alyke absurd to wryte that thou reades not, as to read
that thou wrytes&nbsp;not.</p>

<p>6. We use alsoe, almost at the end of everie word, to wryte an idle e.
This sum defend not to be idle, because it affectes the voual before the
consonant, the sound quherof many tymes alteres the signification; as, hop
is altero tantu<i>m</i> pede saltare, hope is sperare; fir, abies, fyre,
ignis; a fin, pinna, fine, probatus; bid, jubere, bide, manere; with many
moe. It is true that the sound of the voual befoer the consonant many tymes
doth change the signification; but it is as untrue that the voual e behind
the consonant doth change the sound of the voual before it. A voual devyded
from a voual be a consonant can be noe possible means return thorough the
consonant into the former voual. Consonantes betuene vouales are lyke
partition walles betuen roomes. Nothing can change the sound of a voual but
an other voual coalescing with it into one sound, of q<i>uhi</i>lk we have
spoaken sufficientlie, <a href = "#chap1_3">cap. 3</a>, to illustrat this be the same exemples,
saltare is to hop; sperare to hoep; abies is fir; ignis, fyr, or, if you
wil, fier; jubere is bid; manere, byd or bied.</p>

<p>7. Yet in sum case we are forced to tolerat this idle e; 1. in wordes
ending in c, to break the sound of it; as peace, face, lace, justice,
<i>et</i>c.; 2. behind s, in wordes wryten with this s; as false, ise,
case, muse, use, <i>et</i>c.; 3. behind a broaken g; as knawlege, savage,
suage, ald age. Ther may be moe, and these I yeld because I ken noe other
waye to help this necessitie, rather then that I can think anye idle symbol
tolerable in just orthographie.</p>

<h4><a name = "chap1_9">
OF THE ACCENTES OF OUR TONGUE.</a><br>
Cap. 9.</h4>

<p>1. Seing that we fynd not onelie the south and north to differ more in
accent then symbol, but alsoe one word with a sundrie accent to have a
diverse signification, I com<i>m</i>end this to him quho hes auctoritie, to
com<i>m</i>and al printeres and wryteres to noat the accented syllab in
everie word with noe lesse diligence then we see the grecianes to noat
their’s.</p>

<p>2. Cicero, in his buik de Oratore ad Brutum, makes it a natural harmonie
that everie word pronunced be the mouth of man have one acute syllab, and
that never farther from the end then the third syllab, quhilk the
grammareanes cales to the same end the antepenult. Quhilk observation of so
noble a wit is most true in tongues q<i>uhi</i>lk he understud, the greek
and latin. But if Cicero had understud our tongue, he sould have hard the
accent in the fourth syllab from the end; as in mátrimonie, pátrimonie,
vadimonie, intóllerable, intélligences, and whole garrisones of lyke
liverie. This anie eare may if he accent the antepenult matrímonie, or the
penult matrimónie, or the last as matrimoníe.</p>

<p>3. Then to the purpose we have the same accentes q<i>uhi</i>lk the latin
and the greek hath, acute, circu<i>m</i>flex, and grave.</p>

<p>4. The acute raiseth the syllab quheron it sittes; as profésse, prófit,
ímpudent.</p>

<p>5. It may possesse the last syllab: as supprést, preténce, sincere; the
penult: as súbject, cándle, cráftie; the antepenult: as diffícultie,
mínister, fínallie; and the fourth also from the end, as is said sect. 2;
as spéciallie, insátiable, díligentlie. In al q<i>uhi</i>lk, if a man
change the acce<i>n</i>t, he sall spill the sound of the word.</p>

<p>6. The grave accent is never noated, but onelie understood in al
syllabes quherin the acute and circumflex is not. Onlie, for difference,
sum wordes ar marked with it, thus `, leaning contrarie to the acute.</p>

<p>7. The circumflex accent both liftes and felles the syllab that it
possesseth, and combynes the markes of other tuae, thus ˆ. Of this we, as
the latines, hes almost no use. But the south hath great use
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
<a name = "page23"> </a>
of it, and in that their dialect differes more from our’s then in other
soundes or symboles.</p>

<p>8. The use of the accent wil be of good importance for the right
pronu<i>n</i>ciation of our tongue, quhilk now we doe forte, non arte, and
conforming of the dialectes, q<i>uhi</i>lk, as I have said, differes most
in this.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap1_10">
OF THE APOSTROPHUS AND HYPHEN.</a><br>
Cap. 10.</h4>

<p>1. The learned printeres uses to symboliz apostrophus and hyphen as wel
as a, b,&nbsp;c.</p>

<p>2. Apostrophus is the ejecting of a letter or a syllab out of one word
or out betuene tuae, and is alwayes marked above the lyne, as it wer a
com<i>m</i>a, thus&nbsp;‘.</p>

<p>3. Out of one word the apostrophus is most usual in poesie; as Ps. 73,
v. 3, for quhen I sau such foolish men, I grug’d, and did disdain; and v.
19, They are destroy’d, dispatch’d, consum’d.</p>

<p>4. Betuene tuae wordes we abate either from the end of the former or the
beginni<i>n</i>g of the later.</p>

<p>5. We abate from the end of the former quhen it endes in a voual and the
next beginnes at a voual; as, th’ ingrate; th’ one parte; I s’ it, for I
see&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>6. In abating from the word following, we, in the north, use a
mervelouse libertie; as, he’s a wyse man, for he is a wyse man; I’l meet
with him, for I wil meet with him; a ship ’l of fooles, for a ship ful of
fooles; and this we use in our com<i>m</i>on language. And q<i>uhil</i>k is
stranger, we manie tymes cut of the end of the word; as, he’s tel the, for
he sal tel&nbsp;the.</p>

<p>7. This for apostrophus. Hyphen is, as it wer, a band uniting whol
wordes joined in composition; as, a hand-maed, a heard-man, tongue-tyed,
out-rage, foer-warned, mis-reported, fals-deemed.</p>

he is a speedie horse; he is a crouse cock; he is a fat wether.</p>

<p>5. She is the noate of the femal sex; as, she is a chast matron; she is
a stud meer; she is a fat hen; she is a milk cowe.</p>

<p>6. Nounes that want sex are noated with it; as, it is a tale tree; it is
a sueet aple; it is a hard flint; it is a faer day; it is a foul&nbsp;way.</p>

<p>7. In the plural number they are not distinguished; as, they are honest
men; they are vertueouse ladies; they are highe montanes.</p>

OF THE CASE OF THE NOUN.</a><br>
Cap. 5.</h4>

<p>1. Case is an affection of a noun for distinction of person; as, the
corner stone fel on me; stone is the nominative case. The corner of a stone
hurt me; stone is the genitive case. Quhat can you doe to a stone; stone is
the dative case. He brak the stones; it is the accusative
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
<a name = "page29"> </a>
case. Quhy standes thou stone; it is the vocative. And he hurt me with a
stone; it is the ablative case.</p>

<p>2. This difference we declyne, not as doth the latines and greekes, be
terminationes, but with noates, after the maner of the hebrues, quhilk they
cal particles.</p>

<p>3. The nominative hath no other noat but the particle of determination;
as, the peple is a beast with manie heades; a horse serves man to manie
uses; men in auctoritie sould be lanternes of light.</p>

<p>4. Our genitive is alwayes joyned with an other noun, and is noated with
of, or&nbsp;s.</p>

<p>5. With of, it followes the noun quhar w<i>i</i>th it is joined; as, the
house of a good man is wel governed.</p>

<p>6. With s it preceedes the word quherof it is governed, and s is devyded
from it with an apostrophus; as, a gud man’s house is wel governed.</p>

<p>7. This s sum haldes to be a segment of his, and therfoer now almost al
wrytes his for it, as if it wer a corruption. But it is not a segment of
his; 1. because his is the masculin gender, and this may be fœminin;
as, a mother’s love is tender; 2. because his is onelie singular, and this
may be plural; as, al men’s vertues are not knawen.</p>

<p>8. The dative is noated w<i>i</i>th to, and for; as, geve libertie evin
to the best youth and it wil luxuriat. Al men doeth for them selves; few
for a frende.</p>

<p>9. The accusative hath noe other noat then the nominative; as, the head
governes the bodie.</p>

<p>10. The vocative is the person to quhom the speach is directed; as,
quhence cumes thou Æneas.</p>

<p>11. The ablative is noated w<i>i</i>th prepositiones in, with, be, and
sik lyke; as, be god al thinges wer made; God w<i>i</i>th his word his
warkes began; in my father’s house are manie mansiones.</p>

OF THE DEGREES OF COMPARISON.</a><br>
Cap. 6.</h4>

<p>1. Al nounes that wil join with a substantive ar called adjectives; as,
gud, high, hard, sueet, sour.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<a name = "page30"> </a>
2. These, and al that wil admit mare and mast, are compared be degrees; as,
sueet, more sueet, most sueet.</p>

<p>3. Of comparison ther be thre degrees: the positive, comparative, and
superlative, if the first may be called a degre.</p>

<p>4. The positive is the first position of the noun; as, soft, hard;
quhyte, blak; hoat, cald.</p>

<p>5. The comparative excedes the positive be more, and is formed of the
positive be adding er; as, softer, harder; quhiter, blaker; hoater,
calder.</p>

<p>6. The superlative excedes the positive be most, and is formed of the
positive be adding est; as, softest, hardest; quhytest, blakest; hoatest,
caldest.</p>

<p>2. We utter the being of thinges or our awn&nbsp;wil.</p>

<p>3. The being of thinges is uttered be inquyring or avouing.</p>

<p>4. We inquyre of that we wald knaw; as, made God man w<i>i</i>thout
synne; and in this the supposit of the verb followes the verb.</p>

secretes of nature.</p>

<p>8. We permit the will of otheres be letting; as, let God aryse; let
everie man have his awn wyfe.</p>

<h4><a name = "chap2_9">
OF THE TYME OF THE VERB.</a><br>
Cap. 9.</h4>

<p>1. Tyme is an affection of the verb noating the differences of tyme, and
is either present, past, or to&nbsp;cum.</p>

<p>2. Tyme present is that q<i>uhi</i>lk now is; as, I wryte, or am
wryting.</p>

<p>3. Tyme past is that q<i>uhi</i>lk was, and it is passing befoer, past
els, or past befoer.</p>

<p>4. Tyme passing befoer, q<i>uhi</i>lk we cal imperfectlie past, is of a
thing that was doeing but not done; as, at four hoores I was wryting; Quhen
you spak to me I was wryting, or did wryte, as Lillie expoundes&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>5. Tyme past els is of a thing now past, q<i>uhi</i>lk we cal perfectlie
past; as, I have written.</p>

<p>6. Tyme past befoer is of a thing befoer done and ended; as, at four
hoores, or quhen you spak to me, I had written.</p>

<p>7. Tyme to cum is of that q<i>uhi</i>lk is not yet begun; as, at four
houres I wil wryte.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap2_10">
OF THE POWER OF THE VERB.</a><br>
Cap. 10.</h4>

<p>1. A verb signifies being or doeing. Of being ther is onelie one, I am,
and is thus varyed.</p>

<p>2. In the present tyme, I am, thou art, he is; we are, ye are, they
are.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">32</span>
<a name = "page32"> </a>
3. In tyme passing befoer, I was, thou was, he was; we wer, ye wer, they
wer.</p>

<p>4. In tyme past els, I have bene, thou hes bene, he hes bene; we have
bene, ye have bene, they have bene.</p>

<p>5. In tyme past befoer, I had bene, thou had bene, he had bene; we had
bene, ye had bene, they had bene.</p>

<p>6. In tyme to cum, I wil be, thou wilt be, he wil be; we wil be, ye wil
be, they wil&nbsp;be.</p>

<p>7. Verbes of doing are actives or passives.</p>

<p>8. The active verb adheres to the person of the agent; as, Christ hath
conquered hel and death.</p>

<p>9. The passive verb adheres to the person of the patient; as, hel and
death are conquered be Christ.</p>

<p>10. These our idiom conjugates onelie in tuo tymes, the tyme present and
tym past; as, I wryte, I wrote; I speak, I spak; I here, I hard; I se, I
saw; I fele, I felt.</p>

<p>11. The other differences of tyme ar expressed be the notes of the verb
of being, or be the verb of being it self, and a participle; as, I was
wryting; I have written; I had written; I wil wryte.</p>




<h4><a name = "chap2_11">
OF THE ADVERB.</a><br>
Cap. 11.</h4>

<p>1. A word impersonal is q<i>uhi</i>lk in al formes of speach keepes one
face, and this is adverb or conjunction.</p>

<p>2. An adverb is a word adhering mast com<i>m</i>onlie w<i>i</i>th a verb
with one face in al moodes, tymes, nu<i>m</i>beres and persones; as, I leve
hardlie, thou leves hardlie; I did leve hardlie; I have leved hardlie; I
had leved hardlie; I wil leave hardlie; leve he hardlie; God forbid he leve
hardlie.</p>

<p>3. Our men confoundes adverbes of place, q<i>uhi</i>lk the south
distinguishes as wel as the latin, and therfoer let us not shame to
learne.</p>

<p>4. They use quher, heer, ther, for the place in q<i>uhi</i>lk; quhence,
hence, thence, for the place from quhilk; quhither, hither, thither, for
the place to q<i>uhi</i>lk; as, quher dwel you? quhence cum you? quhither
goe you?</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">33</span>
<a name = "page33"> </a>
5. They also distinguish wel in, into, and unto: in, they use with the
place quher; into, with the thing quhither; and unto, for how far; as, our
father, q<i>uhi</i>lk art in heavin, admit us into heavin, and lift us from
the earth unto heavin.</p>

<p>6. Heer, becaus sum nounes incurre into adverbes, let us alsoe noat
their differences.</p>

<p>7. First no and not. Noe is a noun, nullus in latin, and in our tongue
alwayes precedes the substantive quhilk it nulleth; as, noe man, noe angle,
noe&nbsp;god.</p>

<p>8. Not is an adverb, non in latin, and in our tong followes the verb
that it nulleth; as, heer not, grant not; I heer not, I grant not; I wil
not heer, I wil not grant.</p>

<p>9. Ane, in our idiom, and an. Ane is a noun of nu<i>m</i>ber, in latin
unus; an a particule of determination preceding a voual, as we have said
<a href = "#chap1_3">cap. 3</a>, sect.&nbsp;4.</p>

<p>10. Thee and the. Thee is the accusative of thou; as, thou loves God,
and God loves thee. The is the determined not of a noun, of q<i>uhi</i>lk
we spak <a href = "#chap1_3">cap. 3</a>, sect.&nbsp;3.</p>

OF THE CONJUNCTION.</a><br>
Cap. 12.</h4>

<p>1. Conjunction is a word impersonal serving to cople diverse senses. And
of it ther be tuoe sortes, the one enu<i>n</i>ciative, and the other
ratiocinative.</p>

<p>2. The conjunction enunciative copies the partes of a period, and are
copulative, as and; connexive, as if; disjunctive, as or; or discretive, as
howbe&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>3. The ratiocinative coples the partes of a ratiocination, and it either
inferres the conclusion or the reason.</p>

<p>4. Therfoer inferres the conclusion; as, noe man can keep the law in
thought, word, and deed: and therfoer noe man befoer the judg of the hart,
word, and deed, can be justifyed be the&nbsp;law.</p>

<p>5. Because inferres the reason; as, I wil spew the out, because thou art
nether hoat nor cald.</p>

OF DISTINCTIONES.</a><br>
Cap. 13.</h4>

<p>1. A distinction is quherbe sentences are distinguished in wryting and
reading. And this is perfect or imperfect.</p>

<p>2. A perfect distinction closes a perfect sense, and is marked with a
round punct, thus . or a tailed punct, thus ?</p>

<p>3. The round punct concludes an assertion; as, if Abraham was justifyed
be workes, he had quherof to glorie.</p>

<p>4. The tailed punct concludes an interrogation; as, sal we, quha are
dead to syn, leve to it?</p>

<p>5. The imperfect distinction divydes the partes of a period, and is
marked with tuoe punctes, the one under the other, thus : and is red with
half the pause of a perfect punct; as, al have synned, and fallen from the
glorie of god: but are justifyed frelie be his grace.</p>

<p>6. The com<i>m</i>a divydes the least partes of the period, and is
pronunced in reading with a short&nbsp;sob.</p>

<p>7. The parenthesis divydes in the period a sentence interlaced on sum
occurrences q<i>uhi</i>lk coheres be noe syntax w<i>i</i>th that
q<i>uhi</i>lk preceedes and followes; as, for exemple of beath, and to
conclud this treatesse:</p>

<p>The foregoing Tract is one of great interest, not only on account of its
intrinsic merit, but also for the racy style of writing adopted by its
author. We find him continually garnishing his language with such idiomatic
and colloquial expressions as the following:&mdash;“Quhae’s sillie braine
will reache no farther then the compas of their cap” (page <a href =
"#page2">2</a>); and again, “but will not presume to judge farther then the
compasse of my awn cap” (p. <a href = "#page20">20</a>). He observes of the
printers and writers of his age that they care “for noe more arte then may
win the pennie” (p. <a href = "#page2">2</a>), and on the same page he
says, “quhiles I stack in this claye,” which appears to be equivalent to
our term “stuck in the mud.” At p. <a href = "#page3">3</a> he says, “and
it wer but a clod;” at p. <a href = "#page14">14</a>, “neither daer I, with
al the oares of reason, row against so strang a tyde;” and again, on p. <a
href = "#page18">18</a>, we find reason under another aspect, thus, “noe
man I trow can denye that ever suked the paepes of reason.”</p>

<p>It seems that the expression, <i>Queen’s English</i>, is by no means of
modern date, as we have it as the <i>king’s language</i> at p. <a href =
"#page2">2</a>.</p>

<p>Hume laments, in his Dedication, the uncertainty of the orthography
prevailing at the time he writes, and yet we find him spelling words
several different ways, even within the compass of a single sentence,
without being able to lay the blame upon the printers; thus we find him
writing ju<i>d</i>gement on p. <a href = "#page11">11</a>, ju<i>d</i>ge p.
<a href = "#page8">8</a>, and ju<i>d</i>g p. <a href = "#page33">33</a>,
but juge p. <a href = "#page18">18</a>; and there are numberless other
instances that it would be tedious to enumerate. Again, the author uses a
mixture of Scotch and English, so we have sometimes ane and sometimes one;
nae on page <a href = "#page1">1</a> and noe on p. <a href =
"#page2">2</a>; mare and mast, and more and most, even in the same sentence
(p. <a href = "#page30">30</a>); and two is spelt in three different ways,
tuae, tuo, and tuoe.</p>

<p>Our author’s stay in England appears to have drawn his attention to the
differences between the two languages of Scotland and England, which he
distinguishes as North and South. He certainly shows, in some instances,
the greater correctness of the Scotch with regard to the
<span class = "pagenum">36</span>
<a name = "page36"> </a>
spelling of words derived from the Latin; as, retine instead of retain,
corage instead of courage, etc. (p. <a href = "#page20">20</a>), in which
words the redundant letters that we Southerners have introduced are thrown
out. He is, however, by no means partial, and gives us praise when he
thinks we deserve&nbsp;it.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
Page <a href = "#page9">9</a>. The arguments in favour of the sound given
by the English Universities to the Latin <i>i</i> are curious: it is stated
to have its value in the Greek ει; but the author seems to
have been in error as to the English sounding mihi and tibi alike, or our
pronunciation must have changed since his time.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page10">10</a>. The author speaks of the letter <i>y</i> as
being used by the South for the sound now symbolized by <i>i</i> with a
final <i>e</i> following the succeeding consonant, as <i>will</i> with an
<i>i</i>, and <i>wile</i> with a <i>y</i> in place of the <i>i</i> and
final <i>e</i>; thus in the same way he spells write, <i>wryt</i>.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page11">11</a> (7). He gives food, good, blood, as examples
of the same sound, thus inferring that the English pronounced the two
latter so as to rhyme with food.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page11">11</a> (8). He objects to the use of <i>w</i> for
<i>u</i> in the diphthongal sound of <i>ou</i>, and therefore spells
<i>how</i>, <i>now</i>, etc., <i>hou</i>, <i>nou</i>.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page11">11</a> (10). It is difficult here to see what the
pronunciation of <i>buu</i> would be, which the author gives as the sound
of bow (to bow). Probably the sound he meant would be better represented by
<i>boo</i>.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page13">13</a> (12). The author here recommends the
distinction both of sound and symbol of <i>j</i> and <i>v</i> as
consonants, and <i>i</i> and <i>u</i> as vowels, and proposes that we
should call <i>j</i> <i>jod</i> or <i>je</i>, and <i>v</i> <i>vau</i> or
<i>ve</i>, and not single <i>u</i>, “as now they doe” (p. <a href =
"#page16">16</a>), and <i>w</i> he would call <i>wau</i> or <i>we</i>, and
moreover he places them in his alphabet on the same page. If this proposal
was originally his own, it is curious that the name <i>ve</i> should have
been adopted, though not the <i>we</i> for <i>w</i>. Ben Jonson points out
the double power of <i>i</i> and <i>v</i> as both consonant and vowel, but
he does not attempt to make them into separate letters as Hume does.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page15">15</a> (12). He gives as an anomaly of the South
that while the <i>d</i> is inserted before <i>g</i> in hedge, bridge, etc.,
it is omitted in age, suage, etc. He does not see that the short vowel
requires a double consonant to prevent it from being pronounced long.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page21">21</a> (6). He disputes the possibility of a final
<i>e</i>, separated from a preceding vowel by a consonant, having any
effect whatever in altering the sound of the preceding vowel, and
recommends the use of a diphthong to express the sound required; as, hoep
for hope, fier for fire, bied for bide, befoer for before, maed for made,
etc. He uniformly throughout follows this rule.</p>

two distinct words joined by a hyphen, which is the derivation given by Ash

<i>outrage</i>.</p>

<p class = "#pagenotes">
P. <a href = "#page27">27</a> (1, 6). <i>T</i> is omitted after <i>s</i> in
the second person singular of the verb, and so no distinction is made

P. <a href = "#page34">34</a>. In this last chapter on Punctuation, which
the author styles “of Distinctiones,” no mention whatever is made of the
“semicolon,” though it occurs frequently in the MS., as, for instance, p.
<a href = "#page30">30</a>, cap. 6. This stop, according to Herbert, was
first used by Richard Grafton in <i>The Byble</i> printed in 1537: it
occurs in the Dedication. Henry Denham, an English printer who flourished
towards the close of the sixteenth century, was the first to use it with
propriety.</p>

<p>The author continually uses a singular verb to a plural noun; for

our tongue we have some particles.”</p>

<p>With regard to the Manuscript, there are two corrections in it worth
noting. At p. <a href = "#page10">10</a> (6), in the phrase, “the auctours
<i>whole</i> drift,” the word had been originally written <i>hael</i>, but
is marked through, and <i>whole</i> substituted for it in the same
handwriting. At p. <a href = "#page21">21</a> (4), the word <i>frensh</i>
has been inserted before <i>exemples</i>, but has been afterwards struck
through.</p>

<p>The numbering is wrong in three places, but it has not been corrected.

<h3><a name = "report">Early English Text Society.</a></h3>

<div class = "italhead">Report of the Committee, January, 1865.</div>


<p>The close of the first year of the Society’s operations affords the
Committee the welcome opportunity of congratulating the members on the
Society’s success. Instead of two Texts, which the first Circular to the
Society suggested might perhaps be issued, the Committee have been enabled
to publish four, and these four such as will bear comparison, as to
rareness and intrinsic value, with the publications of any of the longest
established societies of the kingdom. The <i>Arthur</i> was edited for the
first time from a unique MS., wholly unknown to even the latest writers on
the subject, and exhibits our national hero’s life in a simpler form than
even Geoffrey of Monmouth, or Layamon. The <i>Early English Alliterative
Poems</i>, though noticed long ago by Dr. Guest and Sir F. Madden, for
their great philological and poetical value, had been inaccessible to all
but students of the difficult and faded MS. in the British Museum: they
have been now made public by the Society’s edition, with their large
additions to our vocabulary, and their interesting dialectal formations.
The <i>Sir Gawayne</i>, from the same MS., could only have been had before
in Sir Frederick Madden’s rare and costly edition, printed by the Bannatyne
Club. And the <i>Lauder</i> has restored, as it were, to Scotland, a Poet
whose name had found no place in the standard History of Scottish Poetry,
and the Biographical Dictionaries.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">.2.</span>
Though the Society started late in the past year, these four Texts were
published within a fortnight of its close; and before that time the first
Text for the second year was in the printer’s hands. The Committee pledge
themselves to continue their exertions to render the Texts issued worthy of
the Society, and to complete the issue of each set within the year assigned
to it. They rely with confidence on the Subscribers to use their best
endeavours to increase the list of Members, in order that funds may not be
wanting to print the material that editors place at their service. The aim
of the Committee is, on the one hand, to print all that is most valuable of
the yet unprinted MSS. in English, and, on the other, to re-edit and
reprint all that is most valuable in printed English books, which from
their scarcity or price are not within the reach of the student of moderate
means.<a class = "tag" href = "#note6" name = "tag6"><sup>6</sup></a> Those
relating to <span class = "smallcaps">King Arthur</span> will be the
Committee’s first care; those relating to our Language and its Dialects the
second; while in due proportion with these, will be mixed others of general
interest, though with no one special common design. The Committee hope that
no year will pass without
<span class = "pagenum">.3.</span>
the issue of one Text in the Northern dialect, as well in acknowledgment of
the support that the Society has received in Scotland, as to obviate the
hitherto limited circulation of the works of the early Scotch writers among
students south of the Humber.</p>

exclusive constitution, or for private circulation only, and might, for all
that the public in general is the better for them, just as well have
remained in manuscript, being, of course, utterly unprocurable, except in
great libraries, and not always there.’ It is well known that the Hon.
G.&nbsp;P. Marsh, the author of ‘The Origin and History of the English
Language,’ could not procure for use in his work a copy of ‘Havelok’ for
love or money; and the usual catalogue-price of ‘William and the Werwolf,’
or ‘The Early English Gesta Romanorum,’ etc., etc., is six guineas, when
the book should be obtainable for less than a pound. Notwithstanding the
efforts of the Percy, Camden, and other Societies and Printing Clubs, more
than half our early printed literature&mdash;including the Romances
relating to our national hero, Arthur&mdash;is still inaccessible to the
student of moderate means; and it is a scandal that this state of things
should be allowed to continue.... Those who would raise any objection to
these re-editions&mdash;as a few have raised them&mdash;are asked to
consider the absurdity and injustice of debarring a large number of readers
from the enjoyment of an old author, because a living editor has once
printed his works, when the feeling of the editor himself is well expressed
in the words of one of the class, ‘You are heartily welcome to all I have
ever done. I should rejoice to see my books in the hands of a hundred,
where they are now on the shelves of one.’”&mdash;<i>Extract from the first

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
